    "# Bayesian Optimization of Fast Charging Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of the Ax Bayesian Optimization framework to tune a multi-step CC-CV fast charging protocol for a Li-ion battery simulated using a P2D cell model (w/ plating) in PyBaMM. Essentially, this project seeks to answer the question: \"What is the charging protocol that maximizes charge in 30 minutes while minimizing aging to the battery?\"\n",

    "\n",
    "We now start with a 5-step charging protocol:  \n",
    "- Step 1: C-rate C1 for 6 minutes \n",
    "- Step 2: C-rate C2 for 6 minutes \n",
    "- Step 3: C-rate C3 for 6 minutes \n",
    "- Step 4: C-rate C4 for 6 minutes\n",
    "- Step 5: C-rate C5 for 6 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "where C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 are the parameters to be optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization objective is: \n",
    "\n",
    "objective = $Q_{30} - \\beta*\\log(Q_{lost})$\n",
    "\n",
    "where: \n",
    "- $Q_{30}$ is the charge stored in 30 minutes \\[Ah\\] \n",
    "- $Q_{lost}$ is the capacity lost due to lithium plating \\[Ah\\] \n",
    "- $\\beta$ is a dimensionless weight that tunes how much the user wants to target high capacity versus low degradation \n",

As the C-rate is doubled from C/4 -> C/2, the amount of charge is doubled but the capacity lost to plating is nearly the same. However, at higher C-rates (ex: 2C) there is significant plating as expected. Finally, when the current starts high but is decreased as the charge progresses (a common strategy used in fast charging), the degree of plating decreases since lithium intercalation is easiest at low SOC. \n",

Although the exact charge currents were different, some solutions had very strong similarities at least qualitatively. Out of the 10 suggestions, two strategies were proposed the most often (4 times each) and here are the results of a representative sample from each :\n",

    "\n",
    "This Bayesian optimization algorithm demonstrates that a 5-step charging protocol can be optimized effectively and the optimal strategy produced by this algorithm is similar to the 3-step BO (\"charge - rest - charge\") and performs slightly better. After running the solutions at 5% below and above the sugggested ones (within the 3C limit), the objective wasn't really improved and so a local minimum was indeed reached. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the exact solutions suggested by this 5-step BO were less consistent than the 3-step protocol, the algorithm frequently presents the user with two valid designs found in the literature: \"long rest\" and \"pulse rest\". This decrease in consistency can be simply due to the presence of more valid solutions because of the higher number of combinations available ($N^3$ vs $N^5$ where N = # of possible C-rates at each step).\n",
    "\n",
    "While this notebook does show the effectiveness of BO in optimizing fast-charging protocols, it is important to note that the exact solution relies on the accuracy of the P2D model. In real situations the model should be parameterized to the actual cell used and a thermal model should be included. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential next steps**:\n",
    "- N-step charging protocol (instead of just 5)\n",
    "- Time of each step as a parameter (instead of 6 minutes for all)\n",
    "- Both N-step + t-step as parameters (most general charging profile)\n",
