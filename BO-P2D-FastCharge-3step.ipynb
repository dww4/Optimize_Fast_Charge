    "# Bayesian Optimization of Fast Charging Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of the Ax Bayesian Optimization framework to tune a multi-step CC-CV fast charging protocol for a Li-ion battery simulated using a P2D cell model (w/ plating) in PyBaMM. Essentially, this project seeks to answer the question: \"What is the charging protocol that maximizes charge in 30 minutes while minimizing aging to the battery?\"\n",

    "- Step 2: C-rate C2 for 10 minutes \n",
    "- Step 3: C-rate C3 for 10 minutes \n",

    "\n",
    "objective = $Q_{30} - \\beta*\\log(Q_{lost})$\n",
    "\n",
    "where: \n",
    "- $Q_{30}$ is the charge stored in 30 minutes \\[Ah\\] \n",
    "- $Q_{lost}$ is the capacity lost due to lithium plating \\[Ah\\] \n",
    "- $\\beta$ is a dimensionless weight that tunes how much the user wants to target high capacity versus low degradation \n",
    "\n",
    "This objective is chosen because it satisfies the following criteria:\n",
    "1. Rewards high capacity\n",

As the C-rate is doubled from C/4 -> C/2, the amount of charge is doubled but the capacity lost to plating is nearly the same. However, at higher C-rates (ex: 2C) there is significant plating as expected. Finally, when the current starts high but is decreased as the charge progresses (a common strategy used in fast charging), the degree of plating decreases since lithium intercalation is easiest at low SOC. \n",

The rest period allows the cell to relax which helps ease the diffusion gradients and thus limits lithium plating. A similar strategy has been discussed in the literature called \"Pulse-Current Fast Charging\" - which has been experimentally shown to maximize capacity while limiting cell degradation due to the inclusion of rest periods. While the strategy recommended by the Bayesian optimization is not really pulse-current (due to the predefined 10 minute intervals), it is remarkable that the algorithm \"learned\" this strategy completely on it's own. \n",

When prioritizing low degradation, the algorithm recommends a profile that is not really fast charging at all (<1C) - which makes sense. \n",

    "To show that this is an optimal solution (at least locally), I ran two more profiles at C-rates 5% above and below the recommended solution. Not only was the BO solution better than both (highest capacity amongst lowest degradation), but it appears to be right at the limit that lithium plating starts to become significant - and the algorithm optimized to this limit completely autonomously. Basically, the algorithm returned the charging profile with the maximum capacity before any significant plating began. (Results below)\n",
